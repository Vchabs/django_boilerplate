# Django Boilerplate with django and react with docker-compose

You should need to use Docker Compose to get this app running. To do so:

## To start postgres:
		docker-compose up db 

## To create and run migrations:
		docker-compose up makemigrations
		docker-compose up migrate

## To load sample data:
		docker-compose up load_sample_data

## To run the app:
        docker-compose up web

## Navigate to:
		localhost:8001

## To create a super user locally:
In order to use the system that is behind an authentication barrier, you would need a superuser on your local machine. 
To do this with the web docker container running:

        `docker exec -it <container name> bash`
        `python manage.py createsuperuser`
And follow the prompts.
